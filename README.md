# Automated, reproducible, transparent, Windows builds for [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), [nghttp2](https://nghttp2.org/), [libssh2](https://libssh2.org/) and [OpenSSL 1.1](https://www.openssl.org/)

  - Packaging aims to follow popular binary releases found on the internet.
  - Both x86 and x64 packages are built using the same process.
  - Standalone `curl.exe` (only [`msvcrt.dll`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_library_files#MSVCRT.DLL.2C_MSVCPP.DLL_and_CRTDLL.DLL) is [required](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140411-00/?p=1273)).
  - curl/libcurl are built with [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)
    support enabled.
  - curl/libcurl features enabled by default:
    <br>`dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp`
    <br>`AsynchDNS IDN IPv6 Largefile SSPI Kerberos SPNEGO NTLM SSL libz TLS-SRP HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy MultiSSL`
  - The build process is fully transparent by using publicly available
    open source code, C compiler, build scripts and running the
    build [in public](https://travis-ci.org/vszakats/harbour-deps/branches),
    with open, auditable [build logs](#live-build-logs).
  - C compiler toolchain is latest MinGW-w64 (non-multilib, x86 and x64)
    either via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (on macOS),
    [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(Debian)) (on Ubuntu via Docker) or
    [MSYS2](http://msys2.github.io/) (on Windows).
    C compiler is [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and optionally
    [LLVM/Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) for curl and libssh2.
  - Binaries are cross-built and published from macOS
    (via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)), using LLVM/Clang for curl and
    libssh2, and GCC for others.
  - Binaries are built with supported [hardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_%28computing%29) options enabled.
  - Binaries are using [DWARF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF) in x86 and
    [SEH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft-specific_exception_handling_mechanisms#SEH)
    in x64 builds.
  - Components are verified using SHA-256 hashes and also GPG signatures where
    available.
  - Generated binaries are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/),
    meaning they will have the same hash given the same input sources and C
    compiler.
  - Because the build environment is updated before each build, subsequent
    builds _may_ use different versions/builds of the compiler toolchain.
    This may result in different generated binaries given otherwise unchanged
    source code and configuration, sometimes thus breaking reproducibility.
    This trade-off was decided to be tolerable for more ideal binaries and
    allowing this project to automatically benefit from continuous C compiler
    updates.
  - Generated binaries are GPG signed with Bintray's [key pair](https://bintray.com/docs/usermanual/uploads/uploads_managinguploadedcontent.html#_signing_with_the_bintray_key):
    **[8756 C4F7 65C9 AC3C B6B8  5D62 379C E192 D401 AB61](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&search=0x8756C4F765C9AC3CB6B85D62379CE192D401AB61)**
  - Patching policy: No locally maintained patches. Patches are only
    applied locally if already merged upstream or &mdash; in case it's
    necessary for a successful build &mdash; had them submitted upstream
    with fair confidence of getting accepted.
  - curl/libcurl are built in MultiSSL mode, with both OpenSSL and
    [WinSSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_Service_Provider)
    available as SSL backends.
  - Optional support for [C-ares](https://c-ares.haxx.se/), [librtmp](https://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/).
  - Generated binaries are uploaded to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).
  - If you need a download with a stable checksum, link to the penultimate
    version. Only the current latest versions are kept updated with newer
    dependencies.
  - To verify the correct checksum for the latest build, you can look up the
    correct ones in the build log as they are generated. Watch for `master`
    branch jobs `CPU=64` and `CPU=32`, log lines starting with `SHA256(`:
      <https://travis-ci.org/vszakats/harbour-deps/branches>
  - The build process is multi-platform and able to cross-build Windows
    executables from \*nix hosts (Linux and macOS tested.)
  - Packages created across different host platforms won't currently have
    identical hashes. The reason for this is the slightly different build
    options and versions of the `mingw-w64` and `binutils` tools.
  - Code signing is implemented but not enabled yet for reasons below:
    - There doesn't seem to exist a way to get _free_ code signing
      certificates, so only a self-signed certificate could be used, which is
      not very useful.
    - The portable tool `osslsigncode` used for signing
      [will always embed](https://sourceforge.net/p/osslsigncode/bugs/8/) the
      current timestamp
      ([Signing Time &ndash; OID 1.2.840.113549.1.9.5](https://oidref.com/1.2.840.113549.1.9.25))
      in the signature, which breaks reproducibility. More precisely, this is
      added by OpenSSL's PKCS #7 module unconditionally.
    - Trusted timestamp included in the signature breaks reproducibility. This
      is an optional feature, though it appears to be good practice to include
      it.
